* Tabcell: Active Cell Tracking for Tabulated Lists

Tabcell is a minor mode for Emacs that enhances navigation and usability within `tabulated-list-mode`. It provides active cell tracking and intuitive keyboard shortcuts for seamless movement across table rows and columns.

** Features

- Highlights the currently active cell in a tabulated list.
- Supports keyboard navigation across rows, columns, and pages.
- Includes customizable key bindings for efficient table navigation.

** Requirements

- Emacs 25.1 or higher
- `cl-lib` library version 0.5 or higher

** Installation

1. Place `tabcell.el` in your Emacs load path.
2. Add the following to your Emacs configuration file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/tabcell")
(require 'tabcell)
#+end_src

** Usage

Activate `tabcell-mode` in a buffer running `tabulated-list-mode`:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(tabcell-mode 1)
#+end_src

This will enable active cell tracking and the associated key bindings.
